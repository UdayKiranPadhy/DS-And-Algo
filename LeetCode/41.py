"""5610. Sum of Absolute Differences in a Sorted Array
Difficulty:Medium
You are given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order.

Build and return an integer array result with the same length as nums such that result[i] is equal to the summation of absolute differences between nums[i] and all the other elements in the array.

In other words, result[i] is equal to sum(|nums[i]-nums[j]|) where 0 <= j < nums.length and j != i (0-indexed).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,5]
Output: [4,3,5]
Explanation: Assuming the arrays are 0-indexed, then
result[0] = |2-2| + |2-3| + |2-5| = 0 + 1 + 3 = 4,
result[1] = |3-2| + |3-3| + |3-5| = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3,
result[2] = |5-2| + |5-3| + |5-5| = 3 + 2 + 0 = 5.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,4,6,8,10]
Output: [24,15,13,15,21]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] <= 104

5609. Count the Number of Consistent Strings
Difficulty:Easy
You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

Example 1:

Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.
Example 2:

Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7
Explanation: All strings are consistent.
Example 3:

Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
Output: 4
Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 104
1 <= allowed.length <= 26
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
The characters in allowed are distinct.
words[i] and allowed contain only lowercase English letters.

5611. Stone Game VI
User Accepted:81
User Tried:149
Total Accepted:81
Total Submissions:174
Difficulty:Medium
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are n stones in a pile. On each player's turn, they can remove a stone from the pile and receive points based on the stone's value. Alice and Bob may value the stones differently.

You are given two integer arrays of length n, aliceValues and bobValues. Each aliceValues[i] and bobValues[i] represents how Alice and Bob, respectively, value the ith stone.

The winner is the person with the most points after all the stones are chosen. If both players have the same amount of points, the game results in a draw. Both players will play optimally.

Determine the result of the game, and:

If Alice wins, return 1.
If Bob wins, return -1.
If the game results in a draw, return 0.
 

Example 1:

Input: aliceValues = [1,3], bobValues = [2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
If Alice takes stone 1 (0-indexed) first, Alice will receive 3 points.
Bob can only choose stone 0, and will only receive 2 points.
Alice wins.
Example 2:

Input: aliceValues = [1,2], bobValues = [3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
If Alice takes stone 0, and Bob takes stone 1, they will both have 1 point.
Draw.
Example 3:

Input: aliceValues = [2,4,3], bobValues = [1,6,7]
Output: -1
Explanation:
Regardless of how Alice plays, Bob will be able to have more points than Alice.
For example, if Alice takes stone 1, Bob can take stone 2, and Alice takes stone 0, Alice will have 6 points to Bob's 7.
Bob wins.
 

Constraints:

n == aliceValues.length == bobValues.length
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= aliceValues[i], bobValues[i] <= 100

5612. Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports
Difficulty:Hard
You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports using only one ship. However, this ship has a limit on the number of boxes and the total weight that it can carry.

You are given an array boxes, where boxes[i] = [ports​​i​, weighti], and three integers portsCount, maxBoxes, and maxWeight.

ports​​i is the port where you need to deliver the ith box and weightsi is the weight of the ith box.
portsCount is the number of ports.
maxBoxes and maxWeight are the respective box and weight limits of the ship.
The boxes need to be delivered in the order they are given. The ship will follow these steps:

The ship will take some number of boxes from the boxes queue, not violating the maxBoxes and maxWeight constraints.
For each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.
The ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.
The ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.

Return the minimum number of trips the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.

 

Example 1:

Input: boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.
So the total number of trips is 4.
Note that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).
Example 2:

Input: boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
Example 3:

Input: boxes = [[1,4],[1,2],[2,1],[2,1],[3,2],[3,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 6, maxWeight = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first and second boxes, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth and sixth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
Example 4:

Input: boxes = [[2,4],[2,5],[3,1],[3,2],[3,7],[3,1],[4,4],[1,3],[5,2]], portsCount = 5, maxBoxes = 5, maxWeight = 7
Output: 14
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the second box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the sixth and seventh boxes, goes to port 3, then port 4, then storage. 3 trips. 
- The ship takes the eighth and ninth boxes, goes to port 1, then port 5, then storage. 3 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14.
 

Constraints:

1 <= boxes.length <= 105
1 <= portsCount, maxBoxes, maxWeight <= 105
1 <= ports​​i <= portsCount
1 <= weightsi <= maxWeight
