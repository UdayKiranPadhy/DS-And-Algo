"""
The general problem statement for this pattern is forgiven situation decide 
whether to use or not to use the current state. So, the problem requires 
you to make a decision at a current state.

Statement
Given a set of values find an answer with an option to choose or ignore 
the current value.

Approach
If you decide to choose the current value use the previous result where 
the value was ignored; vice-versa, if you decide to ignore the current 
value use previous result where value was used.


// i - indexing a set of values
// j - options to ignore j values

for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
   for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
       dp[i][j] = max({dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + arr[i], dp[i-1][j-1]});
       dp[i][j-1] = max({dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i], arr[i]});
   }
}
