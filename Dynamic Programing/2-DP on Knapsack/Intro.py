0-1 Knapsack Problem 
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity 
W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two 
integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights 
associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents 
knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of 
the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an 
item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
