# Given a sorted array of n uniformly distributed values arr[], 
# write a function to search for a particular element x in the array.

# Linear Search finds the element in O(n) time, Jump Search takes O(âˆš n) 
# time and Binary Search take O(Log n) time.
# The Interpolation Search is an improvement over Binary Search for instances, 
# where the values in a sorted array are uniformly distributed. Binary Search 
# always goes to the middle element to check. On the other hand, interpolation 
# search may go to different locations according to the value of the key being searched. 
# For example, if the value of the key is closer to the last element, interpolation 
# search is likely to start search toward the end side.

# To find the position to be searched, it uses following formula.

# // The idea of formula is to return higher value of pos
# // when element to be searched is closer to arr[hi]. And
# // smaller value when closer to arr[lo]
# pos = lo + [ (x-arr[lo])*(hi-lo) / (arr[hi]-arr[Lo]) ]

# arr[] ==> Array where elements need to be searched
# x     ==> Element to be searched
# lo    ==> Starting index in arr[]
# hi    ==> Ending index in arr[]

    # Since array is sorted, an element present 
    # in array must be in range defined by corner 
    while lo <= hi and x >= arr[lo] and x <= arr[hi]: 
        if lo == hi: 
            if arr[lo] == x:

        # uniform distribution in mind.

            ( arr[hi] - arr[lo])) * ( x - arr[lo])))
