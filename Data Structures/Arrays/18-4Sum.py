# Solution
"""
This problem is a follow-up of 3Sum, so take a look at that problem 
first if you haven't. 4Sum and 3Sum are very similar; the difference 
is that we are looking for unique quadruplets instead of triplets.

As you see, 3Sum just wraps Two Sum in an outer loop. As it iterates 
through each value v, it finds all pairs whose sum is equal to 
target - v using one of these approaches:

Two Sum uses a hash set to check for a matching value.
Two Sum II uses the two pointers pattern in a sorted array.

Following a similar logic, we can implement 4Sum by wrapping 3Sum 
in another loop. But wait - there is a catch. If an interviewer 
asks you to solve 4Sum, they can follow-up with 5Sum, 6Sum, and so on. 
What they are really expecting at this point is a kSum solution. 
Therefore, we will focus on a generalized implementation here.

Approach 1: Two Pointers
The two pointers pattern requires the array to be sorted, so we do 
that first. Also, it's easier to deal with duplicates if the array 
is sorted: repeated values are next to each other and easy to skip.

For 3Sum, we enumerate each value in a single loop, and use the two 
pointers pattern for the rest of the array. For kSum, we will have 
k - 2 nested loops to enumerate all combinations of k - 2 values.

Algorithm

We can implement k - 2 loops using a recursion. We will pass the 
starting point and k as the parameters. When k == 2, we will call 
twoSum, terminating the recursion.

For the main function:

Sort the input array nums.
Call kSum with start = 0, k = 4, and target, and return the result.
For kSum function:

Check if the sum of k smallest values is greater than target, or 
the sum of k largest values is smaller than target. Since the array 
is sorted, the smallest value is nums[start], and 
largest - the last element in nums.
If so, no need to continue - there are no k elements that sum 
to target.
If k equals 2, call twoSum and return the result.
Iterate i through the array from start:
If the current value is the same as the one before, skip it.
Recursively call kSum with start = i + 1, k = k - 1, and target - nums[i].
For each returned set of values:
Include the current value nums[i] into set.
Add set to the result res.
Return the result res.
For twoSum function:

Set the low pointer lo to start, and high pointer hi to the last index.
While low pointer is smaller than high:
If the sum of nums[lo] and nums[hi] is less than target, increment lo.
Also increment lo if the value is the same as for lo - 1.
If the sum is greater than target, decrement hi.
Also decrement hi if the value is the same as for hi + 1.
Otherwise, we found a pair:
Add it to the result res.
Decrement hi and increment lo.
Return the result res.

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n^{k - 1})
We have k - 2 loops, and twoSum is O(n).

Note that for k > 2, sorting the array does not change the overall time 
complexity.

Space Complexity: O(n). We need O(k) space for the recursion. k 
can be the same as n in the worst case for the generalized 
algorithm.

Note that, for the purpose of complexity analysis, we ignore the 
memory required for the output.

        return kSum(nums, target, 4)


"""
Approach 2: Hash Set
Since elements must sum up to the exact target value, we can also 
use the Two Sum: One-pass Hash Table approach.

In 3Sum: Hash Set, we solved the problem without sorting the array. 
To do that, we needed to sort values within triplets, and track them 
in a hash set. Doing the same for k values could be impractical.

So, for this approach, we will also sort the array and skip 
duplicates the same way as in the Two Pointers approach above. 
Thus, the code will only differ in the twoSum implementation.

Algorithm

twoSum implementation here is almost the same as in Two Sum: One-pass 
Hash Table. 
The only difference is the check to avoid duplicates. Since the array 
is sorted, we can just compare the found pair with the last one in 
the result res.


Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n^{k - 1})
We have k âˆ’2 loops iterating over nn elements, and twoSum is O(n).

Note that for k > 2k>2, sorting the array does not change the 
overall time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(n) for the hash set. The space needed for the 
recursion will not exceed O(n).
