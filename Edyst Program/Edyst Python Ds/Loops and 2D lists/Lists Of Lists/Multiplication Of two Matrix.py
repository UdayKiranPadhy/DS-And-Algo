Given 2 matrices stored in 2 different 2D lists, you have to print the product of the 2 matrices. If multiplication between them is not possible, then print Impossible

You can find the method of multiplying 2 matrices here: Matrix Multiplication

Complete the given method solve which takes as parameter two 2D Integer arrays and prints out the product of the 2 matrices or Impossible

Example Input:
A:
5 4 3 1  
0 4 1 0  
1 4 2 4  
4 1 2 4

B:
